testing for all QSC devices through LAN. The Tool consists of QAT-
Designer window to create Test suites (TS), Test plans (TP) and Test 
cases (TC).User can view ,modify, search, sort and delete the 
TS/TP/TC in QAT-Designer. The QAT-Runner executes the Test 
suites and execution results can be viewed in QAT-Reports. The tool 
communicates with Q-SYS Designer software to perform execution. 
User has the option to pause, resume, abort and set delay for 
execution&nbsp; in QAT-Runner. Loop option allows the user to run 
specific TS for a specific number of times or for a specific duration. 
User can Drag and Drop option to select the required TS for 
execution from LHS and drop at&nbsp; RHS. QAT reports is web based 
and can be viewed in any standard browser. QAT-Reports maintains 
the records of execution which can be viewed day wise, weekly or 
monthly. Email reports option will send out a mail to the&nbsp; previously 
mentioned e-mail ID once the Execution is completed. Completion of 
execution is indicated to the user by way of an execution summary 
window containing the results of execution. DUT configuration 
discovers the details of devices connected to the QSC device. The 
status of devices found is indicated through different colors. User can 
configure the server&nbsp; path, QSC device credentials, Q-SYS Designer 
version etc in Preferences window. The tool requires MYSQL 
software for establishing database.QAT can handle multiple 
instances&nbsp; of execution simultaneously.&nbsp; </span></font><font color="#010101" ></font></div>
